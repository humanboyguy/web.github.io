<td>Clash of clans</td>
<td><p>Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which players form communities called clans, train troops, and attack other players to earn resources. There are four currencies or resources in the game.[3] Gold and elixir can be used to build and uppgrade defenses and traps that protect the player from other players' attacks and to build and uppgrade buildings. Elixir and dark elixir are also used to train and upgrade troops and spells. Gems are the premium currency.[3] Attacks are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of three minutes.[3]

    The game also features a pseudo-single-player campaign in which the player can attack a series of fortified goblin villages[5] and earn gold, elixir, and dark elixir (levels 51-75 only). The game starts with two builders, but the player can have up to five builders through buying them with gems[6] and even a sixth by getting and unlocking the OTTO Hut in Builder Base 9.[7]
    
    Buildings
    To earn and store gold and elixir, players must build gold mines and gold storages and elixir collectors and elixir storages, respectively. Elixir is used to train new troops, carry out research in the laboratory to upgrade troops, and to build and upgrade certain buildings, mostly pertaining to buildings used in attacking another player's base. Gold is used to build defensive buildings and to upgrade the town hall, which allows access to more buildings and higher levels for existing buildings. At Town Hall 7, dark elixir becomes available; this type of elixir is used to train and upgrade dark elixir troops, some heroes and create dark spells (available from Town Hall 8). The Eagle Artillery is a defensive building only available at Town Hall 11. Town Hall 11 also provides access to a new hero - The Grand Warden. It is the only hero born out of elixir. To earn and store dark elixir, players must build dark elixir drills and dark elixir storages. Town Hall 12 gets a defens called Giga Tesla, which is already built-in after the Town Hall 12 upgrade, while being upgraded to Town Hall 13, the Giga Inferno replaces the Giga Tesla. Town Hall 13 also unlocks of the following: Scattershot and Royal Champion.[8]
    
    There are a number of buildings available to the player to defend their village, including cannons, mortars, bombs, teslas, traps, archer towers, wizard towers, inferno towers, eagle artilleries, and scattershots. Players can also build walls, which can be upgraded as a player's town hall level increases.[8][9]
    
    Troops and spells
    The game has two kinds of barracks (barracks and dark barracks) and two kinds of spell factories (spell factory and dark spell factory). The barracks create troops using elixir, whereas dark barracks create troops using dark elixir.
    
    The spell factories follow the same pattern - the normal spell factory creates spells using elixir, and the dark spell factory using dark elixir. All troops and spells have different properties. As the player progresses, several new troops and spells are able to be unlocked.
    
    At Town Hall 12, the Workshop can be made. This building can make four types of siege machines: the Wall Wrecker, the Battle Blimp, the Stone Slammer, and the Siege Barracks.[10][11][12][13][14]
    
    Clans and clan wars
    Clans are groups of players who join together to support each other, either materially (donating troops) or verbally (giving advice). Players can join clans once they rebuild the special Clan Castle building early on. A major component of the gameplay of Clash of Clans is clans facing off against one another in the "clan wars". Clan leaders and co-leaders can begin wars against other clans. Each clan is then given one "preparation day" and one "war day." When a player attacks a member of the opposing clan, they receive stars based upon the amount of destruction they cause to the opponent's base, 50% damage or more gives 1 star, destroying the townhall also gives 1 star and destroying the entire base gives the remaining 3rd star. Each player is limited to two attacks per war and the team with the most stars at the end of the war day is declared victorious. If the two clans' number of stars are equal, then the victor is the one that has a greater percent of destruction. Players receive bonus war loot if he/she use their attacks in the war. This loot may be different on different bases and is decided by Supercell; the top base has the most war bonus loot and the last base has the least amount of bonus loot. If the clan wins the war, the bonus loot is fully delivered to the player but during a loss or draw one-third of the loot is delivered to the player.[15] In the March 2016 update, 35v35 and 45v45 were removed.[16][17][18] The available war sizes are 50v50, 40v40, 30v30, 25v25, 20v20, 15v15, 10v10, and 5v5.[19][20][21] In the May 2016 update, Friendly Challenges were introduced to allow clanmates to compete amongst other clanmates, however these challenges do not provide loot or trophies and do not affect a player's army.[22] In the October 2018 update, Clan War Leagues were introduced. Clans would fight seven other clans to advance to the next league and earn league medals by earning stars in Clan War Leagues. The clans in the group with the most stars will be promoted to a higher league, while the clans in the group with the least stars will be demoted to a lower league.</p><br><img src="clash of clans.jpg" height="400" width="600"></td>

<td>Clash royale</td>
<td><p>Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which pits players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers, with the destruction of the "King's Tower" being an instantaneous win.[8] After three minutes, if both of the players/teams have an equal amount of crowns or none at all the match continues into a 2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously. If no towers are destroyed during overtime, there is a tiebreaker, where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the least health is destroyed. If two towers have the same health, there is a draw.[9] After an update in late 2018, leaving a 2v2 match multiple times prevents the player from playing 2v2 with random players for some time.

    In Clash Royale, players are ranked by their number of trophies. Players level up by gaining Experience (or King Level) points through donating and upgrading cards. The highest possible level is level 13. The December 2018 Update added Star Points for excessive Experience when players reach level 13, and will award Star Points for previously leftover Experience.
    
    Trophies are won or lost through multiplayer battles, a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a 'crown'), or by destroying the opponent's King's Tower, resulting in an automatic "three-crown" victory (unless the King's Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a draw).
    
    There are thirteen playing arenas in total (excluding the tutorial arena, Training Camp): Goblin Stadium, Bone Pit, Barbarian Bowl, P.E.K.K.A's Playhouse, Spell Valley, Builder's Workshop, Royal Arena, Frozen Peak, Jungle Arena, Hog Mountain, Electro Valley, Spooky Town, and The thirteenth arena (this arena name changes every season), with each arena corresponding to a certain trophy range. A player reaches leagues after reaching 4000 Trophies.
    
    Cards
    Playable troops, buildings, and spells are represented as cards. Prior to each battle (with the exception of the first battle in Training Camp), players construct a deck of eight cards which they use to attack and defend against their opponent's cards. At the start of each game, both players begin with four randomly chosen cards from their deck of eight, except Mirror and Elixir Collector.
    
    Each card costs a certain amount of elixir to play. Players start the battle with 5 elixir points (0 in Double and Triple Elixir modes), and one elixir point is replenished every 2.8 seconds (or 1.4 seconds in the final 60 seconds of the game and the first minute of overtime, and every 0.7 seconds during Triple Elixir mode and the last minute of overtime), with a maximum of 10 elixir points. Once a card is played, a new card is automatically drawn from the player's eight card deck.
    
    Clash Royale first launched with 42 cards, there were 14 cards for each of the three rarities that existed at that time: Common, Rare, and Epic. The February 2016 update added a new rarity: Legendary, with the introduction of two new legendary cards to the game. As of March 2020, there are 98 cards in the game, coming in four rarities: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. The September 2018 update changed card levels as not to confuse new players. All cards now cap at level 13, with common cards starting at level 1, rare cards starting at level 3, epic cards starting at level 6, and legendary cards starting at level 9. All cards are level 9 for all tournaments. The December 2018 update added Star Points to unlock special golden cosmetics for Max Level cards.</p><img src="clash royale.jpg" height="400" width="600"></td>
