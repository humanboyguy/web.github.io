<td>Monument valley</td>
<td><p>n Monument Valley, player-character princess[2] Ida journeys through mazes of optical illusions and impossible objects,[3] which are referred to as "sacred geometry" in-game, as she journeys to be forgiven for something.[4] The game is presented in isometric view,[3] and the player interacts with the environment to find hidden passages as Ida progresses to the map's exit.[5] Each of the ten[6] levels has a different central mechanic.[5] Interactions include moving platforms and pillars, and creating bridges.[7] The player is indirectly cued through the game by design elements like color, and directly cued by crow people, who block Ida's path. Critics compared the game's visual style to a vibrant M. C. Escher drawing[3] and Echochrome.[5] The game includes a camera mode where the player can roam the level to compose screenshots. It includes filters similar to those of Instagram.[1]

    Development
    Monument Valley was developed by Ustwo, a digital design firm founded in 2004 that has produced iPhone apps since 2007. Their Whale Trail game received millions of downloads, and their other apps include design app Granimator and photo sharing app Rando.[2] Monument Valley was conceived as a touch game for tablets. Its development began in the beginning of 2013,[4] and lasted 10 months. It was developed under the working title, Tower of Illusion.[8] It began with a piece of concept art drawn in the style of M. C. Escher, and the final design did not deviate far from this original.[1] Ustwo management did not give the development team a timeline or budget, and instead told them to focus on "making a high-quality product". Games development is not a large portion of Ustwo's revenue, so the company focuses its games development on producing "great products" that reflect well on the company, rather than highly profitable apps.[9]
    
    
    Ken Wong, the lead designer for Ustwo, at the 2015 Game Developers Conference
    Of the art style, game designer and artist Ken Wong said he aspired to make each frame of the gameplay worthy of public display.[3] The project began as Wong's concept drawings before it became a game project.[5] The visual style was inspired by Japanese prints, minimalist sculpture,[2] and indie games Windosill, Fez, and Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP.[4] Wong added that the gameplay was designed to let the player find the object of the game through exploration, without direct guidance. The game uses colors to signify where the player can interact, similar to Mirror's Edge.[3] Wong compared the gameplay experience to a cross between the wonder of a toy shop and the world of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,[2] and its story to a symbolic "song" rather than a narrative book.[7] The game was designed to be completed by most players, a style uncommon for games designed for popular audiences.[1] It was intended to be a "premium experience" rather than a difficult challenge.[9]</p><img src="monumentvalley.jpg"  height="400" width="400"></td>

<td>Two dots</td>
<td><p>unlike Dots, Two Dots has power-ups, objectives and a campaign (series of levels), while lacking online multi-player capability. At the start of the game, only level one is unlocked; each subsequent level is unlocked only when the previous level is beaten. Levels are grouped into "worlds", with the first ten levels assigned to one world, and after that every 25 levels grouped into a world. Worlds differ in gameplay elements, obstacles and objectives. In the earliest levels of the game, objectives include sinking anchors and breaking ice; the objective is to accomplish a target number of each, for example to sink a specified number of anchors. As each world is completed, the player receives a postcard for that world.

    The game now also features a weekly "Treasure Hunt" mode, where players compete worldwide to be the first to complete a sequence of seven levels.
    
    A new world is added with each major game update, currently on a release schedule of roughly once every three weeks. As of March 19, 2020 there are 2625 levels. Makers left a note that say "Stay Pawsitive more levels coming soon".
    
    At the start of each level, the objectives are displayed; furthermore, the player must complete them within a specified number of moves. At the start of a level, a set of dots is "dropped" from the top of the in-game area. The player must connect at least two dots of the same color in order to make a move. They can be connected horizontally or vertically, but never diagonally. The connected dots are removed from the game area; dots directly above those will then drop down until they hit other dots or the floor beneath. When a player connects a grouping of at least four same-colored dots to form a complete circuit, all of the dots in the game area with that same color will disappear, and any dot(s) fully inside the circuit will become "bomb(s)" which will explode in all eight directions once those dots drop down. If there are no two adjacent same color dots to connect, the dots are automatically scrambled so that the player can make a valid move, similar to other games.
