<td>FIFA20</td>
<td><p>Gameplay changes to FIFA 20 focus primarily on a new feature titled VOLTA Football.[8] The mode, which translates to 'return' in Portuguese, focuses on street football rather than the traditional matches associated with the FIFA series.[9] It includes several options to play in three versus three, four versus four and five versus five matches, as well as with professional futsal rules.[10] The mode will incorporate the same engine, but places emphasis on skill and independent play rather than tactical or team play.[11]

    Additionally, players have the option to customise their player by gender, clothing, shoes, hats and tattoos.[12] Following the completion of the three-part series "The Journey" in FIFA 19, players can now have a similar storyline mode in VOLTA Football, which would be played with the player's own character.[6]
    
    Changes were also made to the traditional 11 versus 11 mode to encourage more one-on-ones and off-the-ball space creation. New penalty and free-kick mechanics were implemented and updates were made to the ball physics.[13]
    
    VOLTA Football includes 17 locations, with each providing a unique experience. As well as a generic warehouse and parking lot, players can also compete in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, Cape Town, Lagos, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Rome and Tokyo.[14]
    
    Commentary is once again provided by Martin Tyler and Alan Smith and alternating with Derek Rae and Lee Dixon for all competitions, with Alan McInally providing in-game score updates.
    
    Pro Clubs
    Pro clubs is a game mode in FIFA 20 where players can create personalised pros and compete in a squad against other squads online. The objective is to rise up the Divisions, starting in Division 10 and climbing to compete for the Division 1 title.
    
    Ultimate Team
    Ultimate Team features 88 icon players, including 15 new names. Carlos Alberto, John Barnes, Kenny Dalglish, Didier Drogba, Michael Essien, Garrincha, Pep Guardiola, Kaká, Ronald Koeman, Andrea Pirlo, Ian Rush, Hugo Sánchez, Ian Wright, Gianluca Zambrotta and Zinedine Zidane all feature as icons for the first time.[15]
    
    Two new game modes – King of the Hill and Mystery Ball – are also incorporated in Ultimate Team following their previous inclusion in kick-off mode.[16] Mystery Ball gives the attacking side boosts to passing, shooting, dribbling, speed or all attributes, adding unpredictability to every match.[17] King of the Hill sees players fight for possession in a randomly generated zone on the pitch to boost the amount the next goal is worth.[18] Ultimate Team also includes a new dedicated kit supporting Premier League's no room for racism campaign.[19]
    
    Career Mode
    Career Mode, following feedback from the community, saw some major updates - mainly to the manager mode.[20] New additions include fully interactive press conferences and player conversations, an improved player morale system which can affect the team or individual players stats, performance levels and stance with the manager. The ability to fully customise the manager’s appearance and gender, a new dynamic player potential system, live news screenshots, league oriented UI and new negotiation environments.[21]
    
    Licenses
    The game will feature more than 30 official leagues, over 700 clubs and over 17,000 players. Included for the first time is the Romanian Liga I and its 14 teams, as well as Emirati club Al Ain, who were added following extensive requests from the fans in the region.[22][23]
    
    Juventus, Boca Juniors and River Plate are not featured after they signed exclusive partnership deals with eFootball PES 2020, and instead are known as Piemonte Calcio, Buenos Aires and Núñez.[24] The game would retain the players' likenesses, but the official badge and kits will be unavailable and instead feature custom designs produced by EA Sports and also lose their stadium licenses like the Juventus Stadium, La Bombonera and El Monumental. Bayern Munich is featured in the game with their licensed players and kits but without their home stadium the Allianz Arena.[25]
    
    FIFA 20 will retain the exclusive licenses to the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Super Cup first seen in FIFA 19. The deal includes authentic broadcast packages, branding, and custom commentary.[26] Additionally, the Copa Libertadores, Copa Sudamericana and the Recopa Sudamericana is featured in the game via an update released on 13 March 2020.[27]
    
    Stadiums
    There are 92 fully licensed stadiums from 15 countries in FIFA 20, as well as 29 generic stadiums.[28] Bramall Lane has been included following Sheffield United's promotion, ensuring that all Premier League teams have their respective stadiums.[29] Three new Spanish stadiums have also been added – Estadio El Alcoraz (home of SD Huesca), Estadio De Vallecas (home of Rayo Vallecano) and Estadio José Zorrilla (home of Real Valladolid).[28]
    
    As part of an extensive new licensing deal, 13 new stadiums across the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga will be included. These include BayArena (home of Bayer 04 Leverkusen), Mercedes-Benz Arena (home of VfB Stuttgart), Red Bull Arena (home of RB Leipzig) and Volkswagen Arena (home of VfL Wolfsburg).[30] Also added into the game is the Groupama Stadium, home of Olympique Lyonnais in Ligue 1; Red Bull Arena, home of New York Red Bulls in Major League Soccer; as well as the 2020 UEFA Champions League Final venue Atatürk Olympic Stadium.[31] 2 new stadiums were added in 2020 when the Copa Libertadores was released in March. The stadium Estadio Libertadores de América of the Argentinian club Club Atlético Independiente is now available, as well as the stadium Estadio Presidente Juan Domingo Perón of the Argentinian club Racing Club de Avell</p><img src="fifa football.jpg" height="400" width="600"></td>

<td>Madden NFL 20</td>
<td><p>Madden NFL 20 features a new "personalized career campaign" known as QB 1, following the journey of a player-created college quarterback from their participation in the College Football Playoff, to being drafted by an NFL team. Ten licensed college teams (Clemson, Florida State, Miami, Florida, LSU, Oregon USC, Texas, Oklahoma and Texas Tech) from the ACC, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC, are available in this mode. The mode acts as an updated version of the "Superstar Mode", where the player would take their custom player and control them throughout a career, which was featured from Madden NFL 06 until its removal in Madden NFL 25.[5]

    In September 2019, EA Sports introduced another mode called Superstar KO, as part of the game's first "season".[6][7] In each round, each team plays a drive from their own 25-yard line to score a touchdown and a two-point conversion. If teams draw, the round is decided over a "tug-of-war", where each team does three plays, and the team that advances furthest wins the round. After each round, the winner can draft a player from the rival's team.
    
    EA continued with including accessibility features for blind and visually impaired end users. Not least among these is menu narration, in which options are spoken aloud as the player navigates to them using synthesized speech. As part of his voice role for the game, Brandon advises via the game intro concerning accessibility settings and how to reach them. Other settings like image contrast and color-blind friendly settings are also available. While the majority of menus are narrated, some menus deep in franchise, for example, are not narrated. An example of this is when you are scouting college players, or are trying to purchase free agents or when you are attempting to complete the training. These are some of the gaps in coverage.
    
    Madden 20 brought back game modes from the previous Madden, such as Franchise mode and Ultimate Team.</p><img src="sport game i dont kniw.jpeg" height="600" width="400"></td>
