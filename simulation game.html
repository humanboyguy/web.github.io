<td>Formula 1 2019</td>
<td>F1 2019 is the first game in the series to feature driver transfers, with AI-controlled drivers able to switch teams during or at the end of a championship year.[2] These moves will be randomly-generated rather than scripted events.

    The game includes 18 Formula 1 cars from F1 2018 from the 1972–2010 seasons, with the DLC having a focus on the careers of Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. The DLC also includes the 2010 McLaren MP4-25, driven by Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, and the 2010 Ferrari F10, driven by Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa. These cars were included to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of Codemasters releasing the Formula 1 games on the seventh and eighth generations of consoles.[3] Two Ferrari cars however are noticeably absent. These are the 2002 Ferrari F2002, and the 1995 Ferrari 412 T2.
    
    Players are able to design liveries—including fictional sponsors—for a generic 2019 car in multiplayer modes.[4]
    
    Within the game Racing Point's SportPesa sponsorship is replaced by SpScore.com due to SportPesa being a betting company and the game being PEGI 3 rated. Scuderia Ferrari's sponsor Mission Winnow was also completely removed because of it being an advertisement for the tobacco company Philip Morris International. In a later update, the 90 Years logos were added, along with the real car, to celebrate Ferrari's 90-year involvement in motorsport. Ferrari's 2019 car was also named the Ferrari SF90 for their 90-year anniversary.[5]
    
    Codemasters revealed the presence of the FIA Formula 2 Championship in the game, with a Dallara F2 2018 shown at the end of the announcement trailer.[6][7] The game initially featured the teams, drivers and calendar of the 2018 championship with content based on the 2019 championship added to the game via update in September 2019.[7] The Formula 2 championship is integrated into the game's career mode as a series of short scenarios designed to introduce driver rivalries. It includes two fictional drivers, Lukas Weber and Devon Butler, who act as team-mate and rival to the player respectively, and who will graduate to Formula 1 alongside the player. The full Formula 2 championship can be played separately to the career mode.<br><img src="raceboy.jpg" height="400" width="400"><p>AVAILABLE ON PS4</p></td>

    The in-game HUD consists of multiple "virtual desktops" that allow to manually place a wide variety of "apps" anywhere on screen, and the selection can be expanded through custom apps written in the Python language. The API allows access to the session and simulation data through external LCDs or phone apps and the simulation exports telemetry data in a compatible format for professional data analysis software.</p><img src="assetto corsa.jpg"><br><a href="https://repack-games.com/assetto-corsa-free-download/">download</a></td>
